`y` must be either a simple character vector or a vector of simple character vectors. If `x` is not provided, `r` is a Boolean specifying whether the variable `y` exists in the current scope; if `x` is provided, it must be a scalar struct and `r` is a Boolean specifying whether `y` exists in the struct `x`.
