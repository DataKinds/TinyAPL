If `x` is not provided, `r` is the array where each character in `y` is replaced with its Unicode codepoint and each integer in `y` is replaced with the character with that codepoint.

If `x` is provided, it must be one of the scalar numbers `8`, `16`, or `32` (corresponding respectively to UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 encodings), and `y` must be a character or integer vector. If `y` is a character vector, `r` is the result of representing it with the encoding specified by `x`; if `y` is an integer vector it is the result of decoding it with the encoding specified by `x`.
