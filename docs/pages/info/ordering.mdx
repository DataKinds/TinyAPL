TinyAPL has a total array ordering, which means all arrays can be compared, for functions like Grade.

The ordering is as follows:

* of two arrays with different shape, the smallest is the one with the lexicographically smallest shape;
* of two arrays with the same shape, the elements are compared in ravel order:
	* two values of different types are ordered such that the one that appears first in this list is smaller;
	* two numbers are compared first by their real part and then their imaginary part;
	* two characters are compared by Unicode codepoint;
	* two boxes are compared by comparing their contained arrays, as defined here;
	* two wraps are compared by function comparison:
		* two dfns are compared by their *internal id*, which is a number given to each dfn when it is created; note that the order in which the id is given to two dfns is undefined and therefore dfns should only be compared for equality;
		* two primitive functions are compared by whether they're the same function;
		* two derived adverbs are compared by first comparing the adverb and then the operand, with array operands going first;
		* two derived conjunctions are compared by first comparing the conjunction, then the left operand and then the right operand, with array operands going first;
		* two unwraps of function arrays are compared by the unwrapped array;
		* two trains are compared by comparing their tines right to left.
	* two adverb wraps are compared by adverb comparison:
		* two dadvs are compared by their internal id with the same caveat as above;
		* two primitive adverbs are compared by whether they're the same adverb;
		* two adverb trains are compared by comparing their tines right to left.
	* two conjunctions are compared by conjunction comparison:
		* two dcons are compared by their internal id with the same caveat as above;
		* two primitive conjunctions are compared by whether they're the same conjunction;
		* two conjunction trains are compared by comparing their tines right to left.
	* two structs are incomparable and results are useless.
