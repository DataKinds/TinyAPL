`x` is a vector of naturals, of length either equal to or one more than the tally of `y`. `r` is a nested vector created by inserting partitions between the major cells of `y` as specified by `x`: ones create a new partition and zeros continue the previous partition; higher numbers introduce extra empty partitions as well. Cells before a partition are dropped.
