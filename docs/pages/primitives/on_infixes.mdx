`x` is a scalar integer, vector of integers or matrix. `r` is the result of applying `F` to *infixes* of `y` as defined by `x`:

* if `x` is a positive scalar, it is interpreted as `⟨x⋄1⟩`;
* if `x` is a negative scalar, it is interpreted as `⟨|x⋄|x⟩`;
* if `x` is a vector, it is interpreted as `⍪x`;

Each row of `x` indicates the way infixes are calculated along the corresponding axis of `y`. The first element is a positive integer and indicates the _window size_, `w`. The second element is a positive integer and indicates the _skip count_, `s`. The third element is a scalar or vector and indicates the _mode_; the first element is the mode and the other elements are parameters; modes are explained below; it defaults to `1`.

## Modes

### Mode `1`: Keep Shorter at End

The infixes are `w↑y`, `w↑s↓y`, `w↑s↓s↓y`, etc, until the result is empty. If the last infix is shorter, it is kept.

### Mode `¯1`: Keep Shorter at Start

TBD

### Mode `2`: Drop Shorter at End

The infixes are `w↓y`, `w↓s↓y`, `w↓s↓s↓y`, etc, until the result is empty. If the last infix is shorter, it is dropped.

### Mode `¯2`: Drop Shorter at Start

TBD

### Mode `3`: Apply Transformation at End

The infixes are `w↑y`, `w↑s↓y`, `w↑s↓s↓y`, etc, until the result is empty. If the last infix is shorter, it is transformed with the transformation described by the first parameter, optionally passing the other parameters.

### Mode `¯3`: Apply Transformation at Start

TBD

### Mode `4`: Stencil

TBD

## Transformations

### Transformation `0`: Fill

The edges are extended with the parameter.

### Transformation `1`: Replicate

The left edge is extended with the first value of the list; the right edge is extended with the last value of the list.

### Transformation `2`: Reverse

The edges are extended by catenating the reverse of the list.

### Transformation `3`: Mirror

The left edge is extended by catenating the reverse of the tail (`1↓`) of the list; the right edge is extended by catenating the reverse of the init (`¯1↓`) of the list.

### Transformation `4`: Wrap

The edges are extended by catenating the list.

### Custom Transformation

If the transformation is a function, it is applied with left argument the list, and right argument the required (extra) length, negative if the left edge is being extended, positive if the right edge is extended.
