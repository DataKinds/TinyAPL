`r` is the result of the scalar application of the direction function:

* if `y` is `0`, `×y` is `0`
* otherwise, `×y` is `y÷|y` ($\frac y {\left| y \right|}$)

Note that this operation can be described as the point on the unit circle with the same direction as `y` and is the signum function for real inputs.
